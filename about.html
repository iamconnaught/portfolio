				<p>Hello! My name is Connaught Donnelly and I am a software engineer.  I have lived in Chicago for the past 8 years, but have always considered Chicago-land my home.  I am drawn to coding and technology as a profession because of its creativity and ever-changing landscape.  I am currently exploring JavaScript further, with a focus on Full-Stack development.</p>

				<h3>General Assembly</h3>
				<h6>Software Engineer Immersive</h6>
				<p>Through GA my interest in coding became a reality. I was introduced to so much information and a number of new skills.  Here I learned JavaScript, React, Java, NodeJS and MongoDB. I had an incredible time working on the Projects developed in this course and I am very proud of the results.</p>

				<h3>Chicago Archdioscese</h3>
				<h6>STEM/Computer Teacher</h6>
				<p>This is the time where my fascination with coding first emerged.  As a computer teacher, I was able to develop my own curriculum, and I used the opportunity to learn some basic coding and create some fun lessons for my students.  The youngest students, Pre-K through 5th, explored and created through programs like code.org and Scratch.  But I was most proud of were the middle school student projects in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.</p>

				<h3>First Tee Greater Chicago</h3>
				<h6>Youth Golf Coach</h6>
				<p>While not related to the tech field, my time as a youth golf coach was incredibly important to me.  It was a fun time that allowed me to work with a partner or on a team creating ways to introduce and develop skills in golf but also life.</p>
